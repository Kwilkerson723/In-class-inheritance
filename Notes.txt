inheritance 

create a class where other classes share features from that class instead of writing new classes

"is-a" always refers to inheritance
"has-a" refers to composition
	composition is if your class has another class it is composition
		car is made up of multiple classes 
x ,y
if y isnt x 
	then inheritence 
if x has a y 
	then composition

inheritance should be used when creating classes that have things in common //it is much faster 
classes that inherit share values from the base class

classes can inherit from other classes

Character //base class, has health, name and functions that return the values of health and name
|
|		
warrior   //class that inherits Character values, has all of characters values and functions but also has some of its own such as swordType and a function that taunts
|
|
berserker // Class that is derived from warrior, can do everything warrior can do plus its own unique things


wednesday we cover polymorphism //making the compiler think that one type is a different type?

Fork and expand the code, make an rpg?
